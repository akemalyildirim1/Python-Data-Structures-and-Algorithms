Itâ€™s called naive because it is the simplest way to tackle the problem of finding a specific pattern (such as a word) in a text.

Pattern searching requires two base components:
	*A text to scan
	*A pattern to search for
	
For each character of the original text, we count the number of following characters that match the pattern. 
If a disparity is found, then we move to the next letter of the text, 
but if the number of matching characters equals the length of the pattern, well then we found the pattern in the text!

This means that the performance of the Naive Pattern Search approaches the slow O(n^2)!
